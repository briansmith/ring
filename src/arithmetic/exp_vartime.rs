    // less storage compared to right-to-left scanning, at the cost of needing
    // to compute `exponent.leading_zeros()`, which we assume to be cheap.

    // As explained in [Knuth], exponentiation by squaring is the most
    // efficient algorithm when the Hamming weight is 2 or less. It isn't the
    // most efficient for all other, uncommon, exponent values but any
    // suboptimality is bounded at least by the small bit length of `exponent`
    // as enforced by its type.

    // fact that we require the exponent to be a positive integer.
