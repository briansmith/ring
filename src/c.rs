//! C types.
//!
//! Avoid using the `libc` crate to get C types since `libc` doesn't support
//! all the targets we need to support. It turns out that the few types we need
//! are all uniformly defined on the platforms we care about. This will
//! probably change if/when we support 16-bit platforms or platforms where
//! `usize` and `uintptr_t` are different sizes.
//!
//! TODO(MSRV-1.64): Use `core::ffi::{c_int, c_uint}`, remove the libc
//! compatibility testing, and remove the libc dev-dependency.

// Keep in sync with the checks in base.h that verify these assumptions.
