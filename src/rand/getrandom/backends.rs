//! System-specific implementations.
//!
//! This module should provide `fill_inner` with the signature
//! `fn fill_inner(dest: &mut [MaybeUninit<u8>]) -> Result<(), Error>`.
//! The function MUST fully initialize `dest` when `Ok(())` is returned;
//! the function may need to use `sanitizer::unpoison` as well.
//! The function MUST NOT ever write uninitialized bytes into `dest`,
//! regardless of what value it returns.
