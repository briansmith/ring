/// Reduces boilerplate for defining error types where we want the compiler to
/// optimize for the non-error path by assuming constructing an error is
/// unlikely/cold code.
///
/// WARNING: Every struct/variant must contain some *non-constant* value so
/// that the "invariant code" pass of the compiler doesn't recognize the
/// constructor as being "invariant code" and optimizing it away;
/// although such optimization would be nice to take advantage of, it
/// seems to lose the `#[cold]` attribute.
///
/// Constructor functions ar marked `pub(super)` to ensure that instances can
/// only be constructed from within the enclosing module (and its submodules).
///
/// XXX: #[inline(never)] is required to avoid the (MIR?) optimizer inlining
/// away the function call and losing the `#[cold]` attribute in the process.
/// We'd otherwise maybe prefer all constructors to be inline.
///
/// The type is defined in its own submodule `#mod_name` to hide the
/// variant/struct constructor, ensuring instances are only constructed
/// through the generated `$constructor` functions. The constructor methods
/// work around the lack of the ability to mark an enum variant `#[cold]` and
/// `#[inline(never)]`.
