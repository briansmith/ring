/* Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data.
 *
 * AEAD couples confidentiality and integrity in a single primtive. AEAD
 * algorithms take a key and then can seal and open individual messages. Each
 * message has a unique, per-message nonce and, optionally, additional data
 * which is authenticated but not included in the ciphertext.
 *
 * The |EVP_AEAD_CTX_init| function initialises an |EVP_AEAD_CTX| structure and
 * performs any precomputation needed to use |aead| with |key|. The length of
 * the key, |key_len|, is given in bytes.
 *
 * The |tag_len| argument contains the length of the tags, in bytes, and allows
 * for the processing of truncated authenticators. A zero value indicates that
 * the default tag length should be used and this is defined as
 * |EVP_AEAD_DEFAULT_TAG_LENGTH| in order to make the code clear. Using
 * truncated tags increases an attacker's chance of creating a valid forgery.
 * Be aware that the attacker's chance may increase more than exponentially as
 * would naively be expected.
 *
 * When no longer needed, the initialised |EVP_AEAD_CTX| structure must be
 * passed to |EVP_AEAD_CTX_cleanup|, which will deallocate any memory used.
 *
 * With an |EVP_AEAD_CTX| in hand, one can seal and open messages. These
 * operations are intended to meet the standard notions of privacy and
 * authenticity for authenticated encryption. For formal definitions see
 * Bellare and Namprempre, "Authenticated encryption: relations among notions
 * and analysis of the generic composition paradigm," Lecture Notes in Computer
 * Science B<1976> (2000), 531â€“545,
 * http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/oem.html.
 *
 * When sealing messages, a nonce must be given. The length of the nonce is
 * fixed by the AEAD in use and is returned by |EVP_AEAD_nonce_length|. *The
 * nonce must be unique for all messages with the same key*. This is critically
 * important - nonce reuse may completely undermine the security of the AEAD.
 * Nonces may be predictable and public, so long as they are unique. Uniqueness
 * may be achieved with a simple counter or, if large enough, may be generated
 * randomly. The nonce must be passed into the "open" operation by the receiver
 * so must either be implicit (e.g. a counter), or must be transmitted along
 * with the sealed message.
 *
 * The "seal" and "open" operations are atomic - an entire message must be
 * encrypted or decrypted in a single call. Large messages may have to be split
 * up in order to accomodate this. When doing so, be mindful of the need not to
 * repeat nonces and the possibility that an attacker could duplicate, reorder
 * or drop message chunks. For example, using a single key for a given (large)
 * message and sealing chunks with nonces counting from zero would be secure as
 * long as the number of chunks was securely transmitted. (Otherwise an
 * attacker could truncate the message by dropping chunks from the end.)
 *
 * The number of chunks could be transmitted by prefixing it to the plaintext,
 * for example. This also assumes that no other message would ever use the same
 * key otherwise the rule that nonces must be unique for a given key would be
 * violated.
 *
 * The "seal" and "open" operations also permit additional data to be
 * authenticated via the |ad| parameter. This data is not included in the
 * ciphertext and must be identical for both the "seal" and "open" call. This
 * permits implicit context to be authenticated but may be empty if not needed.
 *
 * The "seal" and "open" operations may work in-place if the |out| and |in|
 * arguments are equal. They may also be used to shift the data left inside the
 * same buffer if |out| is less than |in|. However, |out| may not point inside
 * the input data otherwise the input may be overwritten before it has been
 * read. This situation will cause an error.
 *
 * The "seal" and "open" operations return one on success and zero on error. */
