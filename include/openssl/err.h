/* Error queue handling functions.
 *
 * Errors in OpenSSL are generally signalled by the return value of a function.
 * When a function fails it may add an entry to a per-thread error queue,
 * which is managed by the functions in this header.
 *
 * Each error contains:
 *   1) The library (i.e. ec, pem, rsa) which created it.
 *   2) The function, file, and line number of the call that added the error.
 *   3) A pointer to some error specific data, which may be NULL.
 *
 * The library identifier and reason code are packed in a uint32_t and there
 * exist various functions for unpacking it.
 *
 * The typical behaviour is that an error will occur deep in a call queue and
 * that code will push an error onto the error queue. As the error queue
 * unwinds, other functions will push their own errors. Thus, the "least
 * recent" error is the most specific and the other errors will provide a
 * backtrace of sorts. */
